# Introduction

- Use this guide as a set of best practices and style prescriptions for Ruby on Rails development.
- Treat it as complementary to the Ruby style guide, not a replacement.
- Apply rules pragmatically; some advice is targeted at recent Rails versions.
- Use the section organization to find the right rules quickly.
- Use RuboCop with the rubocop-rails extension when you want automated enforcement.

## Examples

### Good

The team follows the Rails Style Guide alongside the Ruby style guide and notes when a rule is version-specific.

### Bad

The team treats the Rails Style Guide as a replacement for the Ruby style guide and ignores version notes.
